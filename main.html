	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity and efficient: The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>& O(n): <b>Space complexity</b> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. </p>
